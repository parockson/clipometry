Alright 👍 Here’s a **ready-to-use README.md file** for your project, tailored to the fact that **the images are preloaded in the app (not uploaded by users).**

# 📐 CLIP Embedding App for Geometric Shapes

## 🚀 Overview
This app demonstrates how **OpenAI’s CLIP model** can align **geometric shape images** with their **text descriptions** in the same embedding space.  

With this interactive **Streamlit app**, you can:  
- Select a geometric shape from a built-in gallery (circle, square, triangle, rectangle).  
- Select a text label (e.g., `"circle"`, `"triangle"`, `"square"`).  
- View how the **image embedding** and the **text embedding** appear in the same vector space through a 2D visualization.  

This project is a simple but powerful example of how **CLIP embeddings** work for visual-text alignment.  

---

## 🛠️ Features
- ✅ Built-in gallery of common geometric shapes (no need to upload images).  
- ✅ Dropdown menu for text labels.  
- ✅ CLIP embeddings generated for both image and text.  
- ✅ Dimensionality reduction (PCA → 2D) for visualization.  
- ✅ Plot showing image vector vs text vector in the same space.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/parockson/clipometry.git
cd clip-shape-embeddings
````

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**`requirements.txt`**

## ▶️ Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a local development server (default: [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)).

## 📸 How It Works

1. **Shape Selection**

   * Choose a geometric shape (circle, square, triangle, rectangle).

2. **Text Selection**

   * Choose a corresponding text label (e.g., `"circle"`).

3. **Embedding Generation**

   * CLIP encodes the **shape image** → image vector.
   * CLIP encodes the **text label** → text vector.

4. **Visualization**

   * High-dimensional embeddings (512D) are reduced to **2D with PCA**.
   * Both vectors are plotted on the same plane.
   * If the model aligns them correctly, the vectors will appear **close together**.

---

## 📊 Example

* Selected shape: **Circle**
* Selected text: **"circle"**

Result: The image vector (🔵) and text vector (🔴) appear near each other in the plot.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add more shapes and attributes (e.g., colors, rotated shapes).
* Show **cosine similarity score** between image and text.
* Allow multiple selections to visualize clusters.
* Support advanced visualizations (t-SNE / UMAP).
* Deploy app on **Streamlit Cloud** or **Hugging Face Spaces**.
